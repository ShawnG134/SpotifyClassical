						Motivation
					</h3>
					<p className="text-neutral-300">
						I was deeply intrigued by the design and functionality of Apple Classical. As a fan of Gabriel Faur√©, whose piano works I highly recommend, I often found it difficult to locate his recordings. Apple Music elegantly resolves this issue, allowing me to enjoy numerous different versions of his compositions.
					</p>
					<p className="text-neutral-300 mt-2">
						Unfortunately, Spotify does not natively support a similar feature. As a result, I decided to develop my own Spotify Classical Player using Next.js.

						Functionality
					</h3>
					<ul className="text-neutral-300 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
						<li>Discover different recordings of the same classical piece: Enables users to explore various recordings of the same classical music piece.</li>
						<li>Find a complete list of classical pieces by a composer: Provides an exhaustive list of all classical compositions from a specific composer.</li>
						<li>Filter by composition type: Allows users to filter compositions by type (Concerto, Sonata, Symphony) for a specific composer.</li>
						<li>To be determined: Additional features will be added based on user needs and feedback.</li>
